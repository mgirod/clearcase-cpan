ClearCase::Wrapper::DSB
==================================

PURPOSE

This is an overlay module for ClearCase::Wrapper. See the POD for that
module. The short version is that ClearCase::Wrapper provides a
mechanism for extending cleartool while ClearCase::Wrapper::DSB
supplies a number of extensions using that mechanism. At one time they
were mixed together but then I worked out the overlay mechanism and
separated them, such that the most basic extensions remain in
ClearCase::Wrapper and the more optional/frivolous ones are in
ClearCase::Wrapper::DSB.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

VERSIONS

Note that there is no strict correlation between versions of the
base module and overlay modules. I.e. you do not necessarily need
ClearCase::Wrapper::DSB 1.04 if you have ClearCase::Wrapper 1.04.
If an overlay requires a certain feature in the base module this
dependency will be noted in the prerequisites within Makefile.PL.
In other words, if the install sequence doesn't generate a warning
you should be ok.

DEPENDENCIES
