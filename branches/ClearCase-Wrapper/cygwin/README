DESCRIPTION/BACKGROUND
----------------------

This module has grown well beyond its initial design, which was
inspired by three simple observations:

   1. The configurability of cleartool, as represented by
   ~/.clearcase_profile, is badly limited. The only thing it
   can affect is the default comment behavior!

   2. Triggers are useful but only apply to vob-object operations;
   commands like mkview, catcs, etc are non-triggerable and must be
   customized in a wrapper script.

   2. Almost all command-line users of clearcase employ an alias for
   cleartool (typically 'ct' or 'cl').

Noting these all together made me think of writing a wrapper program
which could be installed as 'ct' (or whatever) and could read its own
config file to allow complete and general control of command-line
defaults. Install the program, remove the alias, and life continues
unchanged with no learning curve for users - but the sophisticated user
now has better control over his/her environment and the administrator
can now modify global policies and defaults.

Deciding to write it in Perl was an easy choice.  I was originally
planning to just extend the simple syntax described in the
profile_ccase(1) man page, using something similar to ConfigReader.pm,
until Andy Wardley (author of Text::MetaText) pointed out an old quote
from Tom Christiansen. Tom said something to the effect that if a
program is written in Perl there's no need to invent and parse a
special language for its rc-files; just 'require' (aka include) them
and let Perl do the parsing.  In other words, since perl has access to
its own powerful parser, RE engine, etc. at runtime, why not use Perl
itself as the configuration metalanguage? I took this advice
gratefully.

So it was decided to write a generic cleartool wrapper script in perl
which would allow for site- and/or user-specific configurability.  I
decided to implement it as a module in order to take advantage of the
builtin support for AutoLoading.

This turns out to be a surprisingly powerful mechanism for extending
command-line ClearCase on Unix or NT, because you can not only modify
defaults but add your own new flags or even create pseudo-commands as
well. Making these customizations is tougher than setting up a
~/.clearcase_profile because you need to be somewhat knowledgeable
about Perl, but it also removes an upper bound on what can be done.
Once you set Perl loose on the command line you can do just about
anything with it, as the supplied sample enhancements may demonstrate.

ENHANCEMENTS
--------------

The interesting files in this distribution are cleartool.plx and
Wrapper.pm.  The first is the actual cleartool wrapper program; it's
short, generic, and should need no local modification.  Wrapper.pm
provides some funky importing infrastructure above the __END__ token;
again, this is boilerplate. All the interesting stuff - the ClearCase
customizations - are made in the AutoLoader area below the __END__.

It is not recommended that you modify either of these files for your
own customizations. Rather, a provision is made for "overlay modules"
which let you overlay your own semantics. A sample overlay module is
provided in the ./examples directory along with its own README.

In theory, as described above, ClearCase::Wrapper per se is just a
framework for making your own enhancements. By that logic it should
be delivered without any customizations. In other words, it should
provide only mechanism and let you provide the policy.

However, I think many of the enhancements I've made are of general
interest and may be a primary reason for installing the module, so
here's what I've done. The ones which are (a) widely applicable and (b)
uncontroversial (e.g. don't change native CC defaults) are provided
right in ClearCase::Wrapper. The ones of perhaps less general
use have been segregated into the overlay ClearCase::Wrapper::DSB,
which is also available on CPAN. Those which are site-specific and/or
modify CC defaults, or are controversial in any other way, are in a
site-specific overlay which is not released.

THEREFORE: to get the full scope of functionality, with all published
enhancements, you should install BOTH ClearCase::Wrapper and
ClearCase::Wrapper::DSB. At some point there may even be other overlays
available; check their docs before installing.

Note: older versions of ClearCase::Wrapper, prior to 1.00, had a
different customization strategy involving a Site.pm file. This is
obsolete. If you have a customized Site.pm it should continue to work,
but it would be easy (and much cleaner) to convert it into an overlay
module. The best way to do this is to copy your subroutines out of Site.pm
into the sample overlay module ("MySite"). Rename as appropriate,
test and install, and don't forget to take the obsolete Site.pm
file out of your @INC area manually.

See the POD for further discussion of how to add your own extensions.

The wrapper script also looks for a file called ~/.clearcase_profile.pl
(note same name ClearCase supports except with a .pl suffix) containing
personal customizations. No sample of this is delivered; the syntax is
pure Perl and the idea would be to modify @ARGV before the override
subroutine and/or exec() ever see it. I've never found a need for this
feature, though. See POD for details.


TYPICAL USES / HIGHLIGHTS OF SUPPLIED FEATURES
----------------------------------------------

Not only can you modify the default behavior of any command as you like
by adding flags to @ARGV, you can also define options that you've
always wished for or even build new pseudo-commands on top of existing
ones. Following are some examples of each of these as implemented in
the sample enhancements.

-> A number of cleartool commands don't support automated aggregation
for some reason, so I added it.  Specifically, the provided code
extends the common cleartool flags -dir/-rec/-all/-avobs to the
checkin, checkout, unco, diff, lsprivate, and mkelem commands; thus you
can checkin all checkouts under the current directory with "ct ci
-rec", turn a tree of private files into elements with "ct mkelem -rec
-ci", print out diffs of all current modifications in the view with "ct
diff -all", etc. This is perhaps the most useful enhancement provided.

-> As an example of building a new command, try out "ct edit". This is
a simple pseudo-cmd which runs a checkout and then invokes your
preferred editor on the checked-out file(s). Not rocket science but I
use it many times a day and it saves a lot of keystrokes.

-> An example of removing a minor irritation: one user complained that
"cleartool unco" doesn't recognize and ignore comment flags such as
-nc. This bothered him because if after running "ct co -nc <files>" he
realized he'd made a mistake, he'd use ^co^unco^ (csh syntax for
illustration only) to undo it, only to see cleartool fail on the
unrecognized -nc. So the enhancement accepts and ignores the standard
comment flags.

INSTALLING
----------

Installation consists of the usual sequence of commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Where the install step may need to be run with superuser privileges.
Also, on Windows you'd want to use nmake or dmake instead of 'make'. To
install a private testing version in your home directory, use:

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~

which will cause "make install" to copy files into ~/lib/perl5/....
Then set the environment variable to something like:

   PERL5LIB=$HOME/lib/site_perl/5.6.1

and cleartool.plx should find the local version for as long as that EV
is in effect.

Of course, to complete the installation you'll need to put the script
somewhere on your path, symlink it to a short name such as 'ct', and
remove the same-named shell alias if you have one.

SELF-DOCUMENTATION
------------------

All the supplied code comes with embedded PODs.  Once the module is
installed, these can be read via "ct man ct" for help on the wrapper
itself and "ct man <cmd>" for documentation of specific customizations.

DEPENDENCIES
------------

As shipped, this module depends on ClearCase::Argv which depends in
turn on Argv. It has no inherent need for these modules but they're
very well suited for writing portable enhancements. You need not use
them in your own enhancements, though it's recommended you do. For
performance reasons, the code is designed to load them only if and when
they're used.

DEBUGGING
--------

As the sample enhancements all use ClearCase::Argv, they can take
advantage of its debugging infrastructure. In particular you can see
all cleartool commands as executed by exporting ARGV_DBGLEVEL=1 or
passing -/dbg=1 on the command line. See "perldoc ClearCase::Argv" and
"perldoc Argv" for (lots of) details.

TESTED PLATFORMS
----------------

This module is in use on nearly all ClearCase platforms, including
Solaris 2.6/7/8 and Windows NT4SP6/2KSP2. I'd expect it to work without
significant modification on any CC platform that supports perl 5.004 or
above.

Note that while the module itself works on Windows, the sample
enhancements haven't necessarily been well exercised there. Some have,
some haven't.
