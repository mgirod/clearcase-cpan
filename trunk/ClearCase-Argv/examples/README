This directory contains a set of example programs using ClearCase::Argv.
Details:

- simplest: The simplest use of ClearCase::Argv I could think up.

- simple: A longer script with a bunch of simple, standalone, code
nuggets.

- CCreport: A "real" application which generates a textual report on
changes made across some time slice in some set of vobs by some set of
users, etc., all configurable.

- tarvob: Another real tool though much less ambitious. This is a
standard vob-backup script implemented with ClearCase::Argv. Locks
vobs, tars, unlocks, etc. Don't use this with production vobs without
careful testing and full understanding of what it does.

- fix_eltype: A real script that brings element types into line with
what "cleartool file" thinks they should be.

- mkattr: An example of how to set string-valued attributes which
tends to be the toughest quoting job. All these examples work on both
Unix and Windows.

- envp: Shows how to use the ->envp method to control the environment
of a child process.

- setview: demo of an inline setview in a script using IPC mode.
This isn't possible with traditional fork/exec. It is possible with
CtCmd too.

- functional: demos of the functional interface.

- ./ctcmd: a subdirectory containing examples of accessing CtCmd via
ClearCase::Argv.
