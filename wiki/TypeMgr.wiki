#summary A new type manager for text files

= Introduction =

The source containers for elements of type _text file_ get bloated.
Every new branch results in a full copy. This is only a minor nuisance but may eventually result in problems.

Note that this may also have positive consequences, e.g. enhance the performance of version handling.

Solving it is possible: via a special element type manager.

One might think of branching off an intermediate branch, itself under /main/0. This would however need to be of a shared type (e.g. _m_), and shared branch types are not supported.
In addition, it is likely that this wouldn't help: the base of every new branch would still be empty, and difference from it thus a full copy.

User type managers bring their own quirks: they need to be installed on every client, in a platform suitable way.

Note that the same issue affects some other types than _text files_ e.g. when the source container is shared on a per branch basis.

I analyzed the format of source containers for text file elements [http://www.cmcrossroads.com/cgi-bin/cmwiki/view/CM/FormatSrcCnt in the cm wiki].
