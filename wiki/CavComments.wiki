#summary Issue of Interactive Comments in ClearCase::Argv

= Introduction =

In the current version, commands prompting for a comment hang on Windows (and !CygWin),
but work on unix (not tested in ctcmd mode)

There are two distinct problems in !ClearCase which interfere with the code:
  * a bug with {{{setview}}} under {{{cleartool -status}}}
  * a problem in Windows to catch prompts and provide user input from perl (Note that !CtCmd exhibits the hanging behaviour as well)
The status is to satisfy oneself, waiting for IBM replies.

  * The problem interferes with the work-around for the [http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/support/rational/rfe/execute?use_case=searchChangeRequests&PROD_ID=0&COMP_ID=0&RESP_ID=0&CREATED_BY=314 bug] (RFE 423, acknowledged as defect RATLC01064211, but closed as a user error, and now reopened, I was told) in {{{cleartool -status}}}
  * There is a workaround for unix, which as it is, fails on Windows
  * Interactive comments are not essential for writing scripts
  * It is important for writing wrappers

One can detect the 'setview' request, and indeed start a second process with:

{{{cleartool setview -exec "cleartool -status" foo}}}

(foo being the view).
