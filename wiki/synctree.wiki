#summary ClearCase::SyncTree

= \ClearCase::\SyncTree =

Some recent significant novelties, with some remaining issues

= Reuse, and Version Reuse =

_Shopping for versions_ as _shopping for DOs_

Use of -/ipc=1 flag: benefit for {{{checkin -from}}} commands, which must be run one by one, and are used to preserve config records. Note also that they could be more efficient than copying first and doing a local mkelem, which incurs thus two file copies instead of one.

= Issues =

  * \ClearCase symbolic links are not recognized as such on Windows and Cygwin, by perl -l operator and readlink function: support missing for the source base, which may be needed if using synctree for staging purposes
  * The source files are copied too early, so that they are overwritten or thrown away in several cases ({{{checkin -from}}}, version reuse, resolving symlinks in the vob)
  * The {{{checkin -from}}} option is maybe not respected in all scenarios
  * In the cleanup process, the {{{fail}}} command may result in an attempt to modify read-only data (case not precisely understood).
