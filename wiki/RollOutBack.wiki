#summary Rollout and rollback

= !ChangeSet =

Against the UCM _deliver_, the rollout and rollback functionalities make only sense together.

To some extent, they are already implemented, and only need some convenience wrapping up.

Now, if the changeset being rolled out is well-defined, the one being rolled-back is not easily idenitifed. The offering so far uses +mkview -clone+, which works (until proven otherwise), but is relatively heavy, and non obvious to trace back.

Recording the changeset potentially to be rolled back is possible in many different ways, and I haven't made up my mind yet. Or rather, I made it up several times, and changed my mind.

= Implementation ideas =

Logging now various concerns and ideas, in prevision of future critique, so as to have something objective to work on:

  * rollback is a special form of rollout: it produces a *new* (equivalent fixed) label type, higher than the previous
  * rolling back the rollback offers thus the same data, but a new state
  * the same versions may thus have to be rolled back several times, in different contexts (as part of different rollbacks)
