#summary Quoting issues

= Introduction =

We know of quoting issues in !ClearCase::Argv,
e.g. [http://code.google.com/p/clearcase-cpan/issues/detail?id=13 issue 13].

Some usage patterns must however be identified and discouraged.

= Details =

The main mechanism to deal with quoting issue is via the quote member function, in Argv.pm, and overloaded in !ClearCase::Argv.
It is called for now from Argv::system readpipe, qx, under testing the autoquote variable.

Now, those functions are not called from the ClearCase::Argv overloaded members, in ipc or ctcmd mode.

The problem in [http://code.google.com/p/clearcase-cpan/issues/detail?id=13 issue 13] is to remove double-quotes from the input.
It seems at least easy, and portable, to avoid them in the first place...
