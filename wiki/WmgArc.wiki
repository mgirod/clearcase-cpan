#summary Archiving label and branch types: the semantics

= Status =

Support is implemented, in both cases, and working.
However, whereas it is satisfying and useful as is with branch types, it is clumsy with label types.

= Details =

==Branch Types==

With branch types, the driving semantic is to _archive_ the existing type _away_, so that existing config specs will stop selecting the branches after they have been rolled out (published), and will select the public labels (baseline) instead.

This is fine, since although a new type is created, which is useed nowhere, this is fine: the type will get used _implicitly_ at the next checkout.

==Label Types==

With label types, it is not appropriate to create a type and not to use it: the driving part of the semantics is _mklbtype_ and the reason is that labels are _applied_ explicitly.

In fact, archiving a label type should not happen in conjunction with mklbtype. It could be a separate command.
