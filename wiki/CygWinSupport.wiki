#summary Support for ClearCase on CygWin

= Introduction =

!ClearCase is available on Windows, but not on !CygWin.
Supporting !CygWin in !ClearCase::Argv would result in a wrapper offering the illusion of a port of !ClearCase onto !CygWin.

= Details =

The support should be exclusively in !ClearCase::Argv, not in Argv: the bulk of the applications one might want to use via Argv are !CygWin, not Windows, applications.
The interest of the port is the usage of cleartool via a wrapper.

The problems to solve are:
  * input paths
  * output paths
  * end-of-line convention in cleartool output
