#summary Support for ClearCase on CygWin

= Introduction =

!ClearCase is available on Windows, but not on !CygWin.
Supporting !CygWin in !ClearCase::Argv would result in a wrapper offering the illusion of a port of !ClearCase onto !CygWin.

= Details =

The support should be exclusively in !ClearCase::Argv, not in Argv: the bulk of the applications one might want to use via Argv are !CygWin, not Windows, applications.
The interest of the port is the usage of cleartool via a wrapper.

The problems to solve are:
  * input paths
  * output paths
  * end-of-line convention in cleartool output

I started to work on it in a _cygwin_ branch, but the result so far is not quite convincing.
  * I see how to deal with {{{qx}}}, but not that well with {{{system}}} or {{{pipe}}}. {{{system}}} is required for a wrapper.
  * I need more than just tweaking the paths: also the config spec rules, for instance, or the version extended paths.
  * {{{lsvob}}} returns vob paths without any kind of view mapped drive.
  * I tried the wrapper, but it fails for now in simple cases such as: {{{ctx setcs /tmp/cs}}}
  * {{{ctx lsgen ...}}} seems to work at least in some cases.
