CPAN is a great delivery site.
But it doesn't offer a way to version scripts while they are being edited, which becomes necessary as soon as there are more than 2 people collaborating.
Also, there is a need to maintain design documents beyond what the mere user wants to download and install, as well as to keep a log of related communications.
