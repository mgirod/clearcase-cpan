The ct.bat file is an example of a redirector. If you have a UNIX/SMB
solution such as Samba running you should be able to use this to
execute the exact same script, same copy, on Unix and Windows.

The MySite.tar.gz file is a sample enhancement overlay. To create
your own cleartool enhancements, you should be able to simply
unpack MySite.tar.gz, change all references to 'MySite' (including
the containing directory) to something which makes more sense for
your site. Then add subroutines to the (renamed) MySite.pm file
and go through the standard

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

sequence and test your additions. Don't forget to put your new module
under source (ClearCase) control.

Alternatively, if you want to develop an enhancement which isn't
site-specific and that you want to release to CPAN, remove the 'Site'
part from the package namespace, add copyright and license information,
and you're away.

The CGC.tar.gz file is similar to MySite, but it's a real site-specific
overlay that I use. Normally the whole point of overlays in the Site::*
namespace is that they're not released but I ship mine for pedagogical
purposes. So please don't install it as is; use it as a reference
for site-specific overlays.
