<h1><a name="raison_d_etre">RAISON D'ETRE</a></h1>
<p>Argv presents an OO approach to command lines, allowing you to
instantiate an 'argv object', manipulate it, and eventually execute it,
e.g.:</p>
<pre>
    my $ls = Argv-&gt;new('ls', ['-l']));
    my $rc = $ls-&gt;system;       # or $ls-&gt;exec or $ls-&gt;qx</pre>
<p>Which raises the immediate question - what value does this mumbo-jumbo
add over Perl's native way of doing the same thing:</p>
<pre>
    my $rc = system(qw(ls -l));</pre>
<p>The answer comes in a few parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_structure">STRUCTURE</a></strong>

<p>First, Argv recognizes the underlying property of an arg vector, which
is that it begins with a <strong>program name</strong> potentially followed by
<strong>options</strong> and then <strong>operands</strong>. An Argv object factors a raw argv into
these three groups, provides accessor methods to allow operations on
each group independently, and can then paste them back together for
execution.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_option_sets">OPTION SETS</a></strong>

<p>Second, Argv encapsulates and extends <code>Getopt::Long</code> to allow parsing
of the argv's options into different <em>option sets</em>. This is useful in
the case of wrapper programs which may, for instance, need to parse out
one set of flags which direct the behavior of the wrapper itself, extract
a different set and pass them to program X, another for program Y, then
exec program Z with the remainder.  Doing this kind of thing on a basic
@ARGV using indexing and splicing is do-able but leads to spaghetti-ish
code.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_extra_features">EXTRA FEATURES</a></strong>

<p>The <em>execution methods</em> <code>system, exec, qx, and pipe</code> extend their
Perl builtin analogues in a few ways, for example:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a name="item_an_xargs_2dlike_capability_without_shell_intervent">An xargs-like capability without shell intervention.</a></strong>

<li><strong><a name="item_exec">UNIX-like <code>exec()</code> behavior on Windows.</a></strong>

<li><strong><a name="item_system">Automatic quoting of <code>system()</code> on Win32 and <a href="#item_qx"><code>qx()</code></a>/<a href="#item_pipe"><code>pipe()</code></a>
everywhere.</a></strong>

<li><strong><a name="item_globbing">Automatic globbing (primarily for Windows).</a></strong>

<li><strong><a name="item_automatic_chomping_2e">Automatic chomping.</a></strong>

<li><strong><a name="item_normalization">Pathname normalization (primarily for Windows).</a></strong>

</ol>
</ul>
<p>All of these behaviors are optional and may be toggled either as class
or instance attributes. See EXECUTION ATTRIBUTES below.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>An Argv object treats a command line as 3 separate entities: the
<em>program</em>, the <em>options</em>, and the <em>args</em>. The <em>options</em> may be
further subdivided into user-defined <em>option sets</em> by use of the
<a href="#item_optset"><code>optset</code></a> method. When one of the <em>execution methods</em> is called, the
parts are reassembled into a single list and passed to the underlying
Perl execution function.</p>
<p>Compare this with the way Perl works natively, keeping the 0th element
of the argv in <code>$0</code> and the rest in <code>@ARGV</code>.</p>
<p>By default there's one option set, known as the <em>anonymous option
set</em>, whose name is the null string. All parsed options go there.  The
advanced user can define more option sets, parse options into them
according to Getopt::Long-style descriptions, query or set the parsed
values, and then reassemble them in any way desired at exec time.
Declaring an option set automatically generates a set of methods for
manipulating it (see below).</p>
<p>All argument-parsing within Argv is done via Getopt::Long.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="autoloading">AUTOLOADING</a></h1>
<p>Argv employs the same technique made famous by the Shell module
to allow any command name to be used as a method. E.g.</p>
<pre>
        $obj-&gt;date-&gt;exec;</pre>
<p>will run the 'date' command. Internally this is translated into</p>
<pre>
        $obj-&gt;argv('date')-&gt;exec;</pre>
<p>See the <a href="#item_argv"><code>argv</code></a> method below.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="functional_interface">FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE</a></h1>
<p>Because the extensions to <code>system/exec/qx</code> described above may be
helpful in writing portable programs, the methods are also made
available for export as traditional functions. Thus:</p>
<pre>
    use Argv qw(system exec qv pipe);</pre>
<p>will override the Perl builtins. There's no way (that I know of) to
override the operator <a href="#item_qx"><code>qx()</code></a> so an alias <code>qv()</code> is provided.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="constructor">CONSTRUCTOR</a></h1>
<pre>
    my $obj = Argv-&gt;new(@list)</pre>
<p>The <code>@list</code> is what will be parsed/executed/etc by subsequent method
calls. During initial construction, the first element of the list is
separated off as the <em>program</em>; the rest is lumped together as part of
the <em>args</em> until and unless option parsing is done, in which case
matched options are shifted into collectors for their various <em>option
sets</em>. You can also create a ``predigested'' instance by passing any or
all of the prog, opt, or arg parts as array refs. E.g.</p>
<pre>
    Argv-&gt;new([qw(cvs ci)], [qw(-l -n)], qw(file1 file2 file3));</pre>
<p>Predigested options are placed in the default (anonymous) option set.</p>
<p>The constructor can be used as a class or instance method. In the
latter case the new object is a deep (full) clone of its progenitor.
In fact there's a <code>clone</code> method which is an alias to <code>new</code>, allowing
clones to be created via:</p>
<pre>
        my $copy = $orig-&gt;clone;</pre>
<p>The first argument to <code>new()</code> or <code>clone()</code> may be a hash-ref, which
will be used to set <em>execution attributes</em> at construction time. I.e.:</p>
<pre>
    my $obj = Argv-&gt;new({autochomp =&gt; 1, stderr =&gt; 0}, @ARGV);</pre>
<p>You may choose to create an object and add the command line later:</p>
<pre>
    my $obj = Argv-&gt;new;
    $obj-&gt;prog('cat');
    $obj-&gt;args('/etc/motd');</pre>
<p>Or</p>
<pre>
    my $obj = Argv-&gt;new({autochomp=&gt;1});
    my $motd = $obj-&gt;argv(qw(cat /etc/motd))-&gt;qx;</pre>
<p>Or (using the autoloading interface)</p>
<pre>
    my $motd = $obj-&gt;cat('/etc/motd')-&gt;qx;</pre>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="methods">METHODS</a></h1>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="instance_methods">INSTANCE METHODS</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_prog"><code>prog()</code></a></strong>

<p>Returns or sets the name of the program (the <code>&quot;argv[0]&quot;</code>). The
argument may be a list, e.g. <code>qw(rcs co)</code> or an array reference.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_opts"><code>opts()</code></a></strong>

<p>Returns or sets the list of operands (aka arguments). As above, it may
be passed a list or an array reference. This is simply the member of
the class of opts<em>NAME</em>() methods (see below) whose &lt;NAME&gt; is null;
it's part of the predefined <em>anonymous option set</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_args"><code>args()</code></a></strong>

<p>Returns or sets the list of operands (aka arguments).  If called in a
void context and without args, the effect is to set the list of
operands to <code>()</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_argv"><code>argv()</code></a></strong>

<p>Allows you to set the prog, opts, and args in one method call. It takes
the same arguments as the constructor (above); the only difference is
it operates on a pre-existing object to replace its attributes. I.e.</p>
<pre>
    my $obj = Argv-&gt;new;
    $obj-&gt;argv('cmd', [qw(-opt1 -opt2)], qw(arg1 arg2));</pre>
<p>is equivalent to</p>
<pre>
    my $obj = Argv-&gt;new('cmd', [qw(-opt1 -opt2)], qw(arg1 arg2));</pre>
<p>Without arguments, returns the current arg vector as it would be
executed:</p>
<pre>
    my @cmd = $ct-&gt;argv;</pre>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_optset">optset(&lt;list-of-set-names&gt;);</a></strong>

<p>For each name <em>NAME</em> in the parameter list, an <em>option set</em> of that
name is declared and 3 new methods are registered dynamically:
<a href="#item_parsename"><code>parseNAME(), optsNAME(), and flagNAME()</code></a>. These methods are
described below: note that the <em>anonymous option set</em> (see <em>OPTION
SETS</em>) is predefined, so the methods <code>parse(), opts(), and flag()</code> are
always available.  Most users won't need to define any other sets.
Note that option-set names are forced to upper case. E.g.:</p>
<pre>
    $obj-&gt;optset('FOO');</pre>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_parsename">parse<em>NAME</em>(...option-descriptions...)</a></strong>

<p>Takes a list of option descriptions and uses Getopt::Long::GetOptions()
to parse them out of the current argv <strong>and into option set <em>NAME</em></strong>.
The opt-descs are exactly as supported by parse<em>FOO</em>() are exactly the
same as those described for Getopt::Long, except that no linkage
argument is allowed. E.g.:</p>
<pre>
    $obj-&gt;parseFOO(qw(file=s list=s@ verbose));</pre>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_optsname">opts<em>NAME</em>()</a></strong>

<p>Returns or sets the list of options in the <strong>option set <em>NAME</em></strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_flagname">flag<em>NAME</em>()</a></strong>

<p>Sets or gets the value of a flag in the appropriate optset, e.g.:</p>
<pre>
    print &quot;blah blah blah\n&quot; if $obj-&gt;flagFOO('verbose');
    $obj-&gt;flagFOO('verbose' =&gt; 1);</pre>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_extract">extract</a></strong>

<p>Takes an <em>optset</em> name and a list of option descs; creates the named
optset, extracts any of the named options, places them in the specified
optset, and returns them.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_quote"><code>quote(@list)</code></a></strong>

<p>Protects the argument list against exposure to a shell by quoting each
element. This method is invoked automatically by the <em>system</em> method
on Windows platforms, where the underlying <em>system</em> primitive always
uses a shell, and by the <em>qx</em> method on all platforms since it invokes
a shell on all platforms.</p>
<p>The automatic use of <em>quote</em> can be turned off via the <em>autoquote</em>
method (see).</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: this method quotes its argument list <strong>in place</strong>. In other
words, it may modify the arguments.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_glob">glob</a></strong>

<p>Expands the argument list using the Perl <em>glob</em> builtin. Primarily
useful on Windows where the invoking shell does not do this for you.</p>
<p>Automatic use of <em>glob</em> on Windows can be enabled via the <em>autoglob</em>
method (vide infra).</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_objdump">objdump</a></strong>

<p>A no-op except for printing the state of the invoking instance to
stderr. Potentially useful for debugging in situations where access to
<em>perl -d</em> is limited, e.g. across a socket connection or in a
crontab. Invoked automatically at <em>dbglevel=3</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_readonly">readonly</a></strong>

<p>Sets/gets the ``readonly'' attribute, which is a string indicating
whether the instance is to be used for read operations only. If the
attribute's value starts with <code>y</code>, execution methods will be allowed
to proceed even if the <a href="#item_noexec"><code>$obj-&gt;noexec</code></a> attribute is set.</p>
<p>The value of this is that it enables your script to have a <code>-n</code> flag,
a la <code>make -n</code>, pretty easily by careful management of
<a href="#item_readonly"><code>-&gt;readonly</code></a> and <a href="#item_noexec"><code>-&gt;noexec</code></a>.  Consider a script which runs
<code>ls</code> to determine whether a file exists and then, conditionally, uses
<code>rm -f</code> to remove it.  Causing a <code>-n</code> flag from the user to set
<a href="#item_noexec"><code>-&gt;noexec</code></a> alone would break the program logic since the <code>ls</code>
would be skipped too. But, if you take care to use objects with the
<em>readonly</em> attribute set for all read-only operations, perhaps by
defining a special read-only object:</p>
<pre>
        my $ro = Argv-&gt;new;
        $ro-&gt;readonly('yes');
        $ro-&gt;ls('/tmp')-&gt;system;</pre>
<p>then the <code>-n</code> flag will cause only write operations to be skipped.</p>
<p>Note that, if you choose to use this feature at all, determining which
operations are readonly is entirely the programmer's responsibility.
There's no way for Argv to determine whether a child process will
modify state.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="execution_methods">EXECUTION METHODS</a></h2>
<p>The three methods below are direct analogues of the Perl builtins.
They simply reassemble a command line from the <em>prog</em>, <em>opts</em>, and
<em>args</em> parts according to the option-set rules described below and
invoke their builtin equivalent on it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>system([&lt;optset-list&gt;])</strong>

<p>Reassembles the argv and invokes system(). Return value and value of
$?, $!, etc. are just as described in <em>perlfunc/``system''</em></p>
<p>Arguments to this method determine which of the parsed option-sets will
be used in the executed argv. If passed no arguments, <a href="#item_system"><code>$obj-&gt;system</code></a>
uses the value of the 'dfltsets' attribute as the list of desired sets.
The default value of 'dfltsets' is the anonymous option set.</p>
<p>An option set may be requested by passing its name (with an optional
leading '+') or explicitly rejected by using its name with a leading
'-'. Thus, given the existence of option sets <em>ONE, TWO, and THREE</em>,
the following are legal:</p>
<pre>
    $obj-&gt;system;                       # use the anonymous set only
    $obj-&gt;system('+');                  # use all option sets
    $obj-&gt;system(qw(ONE THREE);         # use sets ONE and THREE</pre>
<p>The following sequence would also use sets ONE and THREE.</p>
<pre>
    $obj-&gt;dfltsets({ONE =&gt; 1, THREE =&gt; 1});
    $obj-&gt;system;</pre>
<p>while this would use all parsed options:</p>
<pre>
    $obj-&gt;dfltsets({'+' =&gt; 1});
    $obj-&gt;system;</pre>
<p>and this would set the default to none class-wide, and then use it:</p>
<pre>
    $obj-&gt;dfltsets({'-' =&gt; 1});
    $obj-&gt;system;</pre>
<p>By default the <a href="#item_system"><code>$obj-&gt;system</code></a> method autoquotes its arguments <em>iff</em>
the platform is Windows and the arguments are a list, because in this
case a shell is always used. This behavior can be toggled with
<a href="#item_autoquote"><code>$obj-&gt;autoquote</code></a>.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>exec([&lt;optset-list&gt;])</strong>

<p>Similar to <em>system</em> above, but never returns. On Windows, it blocks
until the new process finishes for a more UNIX-like behavior than the
<em>exec</em> implemented by the MSVCRT, if the <strong>execwait</strong> attribute is set.
This is actually implemented as</p>
<pre>
    exit($obj-&gt;system(LIST));</pre>
<p>on Windows, and thus all <a href="#item_system"><code>system</code></a> shell-quoting issues apply</p>
<p>Option sets are handled as described in <em>system</em> above.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_qx">qx([&lt;optset-list&gt;])</a></strong>

<p>Same semantics as described in <em>perlfunc/``qx''</em> but has the capability
to process only a set command line length at a time to avoid exceeding
OS line-length limits. This value is settable with the <em>qxargs</em>
method.</p>
<p>One difference from the builtin <em>perlfunc/``qx''</em> is that the builtin
allows you to leave off the double quotes around the command string
(though they are always there implicitly), whereas the <em>qv()</em>
functional interface <em>must use literal quotes</em>. For instance, using
<em>qx()</em> you can use either of:</p>
<pre>
    my @results = qx(command string here);
    my @results = qx(&quot;command string here&quot;);</pre>
<p>which are semantically identical, but with <em>qv()</em> you must use the
latter form.</p>
<p>Also, if <em>autoquote</em> is set the arguments are escaped to protect them
against the platform-standard shell <em>on all platforms</em>.</p>
<p>Option sets are handled as described in <em>system</em> above.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_pipe">pipe([&lt;optset-list&gt;])</a></strong>

<p>Provides functionality to use the 'open' process pipe mechanism in
order to read output line by line and optionally stop reading early.
This is useful if the process you are reading can be lengthy but where
you can quickly determine whether you need to let the process finish or
if you need to save all output.  This can save a lot of time and/or
memory in many scenarios.</p>
<p>You must pass in a callback code reference using <code>-&gt;pipecb</code>. This
callback will receive one line at a time (autochomp is active). The
callback can do whatever it likes with this line. The callback should
return a false value to abort early, but for this to be honored, the
Argv instance should be marked 'readonly' using the <a href="#item_readonly"><code>-&gt;readonly</code></a>
method. A default callback is in effect at start that merely prints the
output.</p>
<p><a href="#item_pipe"><code>-&gt;pipe</code></a> is otherwise similar to, and reuses settings for <em>qx</em>
(except for the ability to limit command line lengths).</p>
<p>Without exhaustive testing, this is believed to work in a well-behaved
manner on Unix.</p>
<p>However, on Windows a few caveats apply. These appear to be limitations
in the underlying implementation of both Perl and Windows.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a name="item_windows_has_no_concept_of_sigpipe_2e_thus_2c_just_">Windows has no concept of SIGPIPE. Thus, just closing the pipe handle
will not necessarily cause the child process to quit. Bummer :-(.</a></strong>

<li><strong><a name="item_stderr">Sometimes an extra process is inserted. For example, if stderr
has been redirected using $obj-&gt;<code>stderr(1)</code> (send stderr to stdout), this
causes Perl to utilize the shell as an intermediary process, meaning
that even if the shell process quits, its child will continue.</a></strong>

</ol>
<p>For the above reasons, in case of an abort request, on Windows we take it
further and forcibly kill the process tree stemming from the pipe. However,
to make this kill the full tree, some nonstandard packages are required.
Currently any of these will work:</p>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_win32_3a_3aprocess_3a_3ainfo">Win32::Process::Info</a></strong>

<li><strong><a name="item_win32_3a_3atoolhelp">Win32::ToolHelp</a></strong>

<p>Both are available as PPM packages for ActiveState perls, or on CPAN.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="execution_attributes">EXECUTION ATTRIBUTES</a></h2>
<p>The behavior of the <em>execution methods</em> <code>system, exec, and qx</code> is
governed by a set of <em>execution attributes</em>, which are in turn
manipulated via a set of eponymous methods. These methods are
auto-generated and thus share certain common characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_translucency">Translucency</a></strong>

<p>They can all be invoked as class or instance methods.  If used as an
instance method the attribute is set only on that object; if used on
the class it sets or gets the default for all instances which haven't
overridden it.  This is inspired by the section on <em>translucent
attributes</em> in Tom Christiansen's <em>perltootc</em> tutorial.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_class_defaults">Class Defaults</a></strong>

<p>Each attribute has a class default which may be overridden with an
environment variable by prepending the class name, e.g. ARGV_QXARGS=256
or ARGV_STDERR=0;</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_context_sensitivity">Context Sensitivity</a></strong>

<p>The attribute value is always a scalar. If a value is passed it
becomes the new value of the attribute and the object or class is
returned. If no value is passed <em>and there is a valid return
context</em>, the current value is returned. In a void context with no
parameter, the attribute value is set to 1.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_stickiness">Stickiness (deprecated)</a></strong>

<p>A subtlety: if an <em>execution attribute</em> is set in a void context, that
attribute is <em>``sticky''</em>, i.e. it retains its state until explicitly
changed. But <em>if a new value is provided and the context is not void</em>,
the new value is <strong>temporary</strong>. It lasts until the next <em>execution
method</em> (<code>system, exec, or qx</code>) invocation, after which the previous
value is restored. This feature allows locutions like this:</p>
<pre>
        $obj-&gt;cmd('date')-&gt;stderr(1)-&gt;system;</pre>
<p>Assuming that the <code>$obj</code> object already exists and has a set of
attributes; we can override one of them at execution time. The next
time <code>$obj</code> is used, stderr will go back to wherever it was directed
before. More examples:</p>
<pre>
        $obj-&gt;stdout(1);          # set attribute, sticky
        $obj-&gt;stdout;             # same as above
        $foo = $obj-&gt;stdout;      # get attribute value
        $obj2 = $obj-&gt;stdout(1);  # set to 1 (temporary), return $obj</pre>
<p>WARNING: this attribute-stacking has turned out to be a bad idea. Its
use is now deprecated. There are other ways to get to the same place:
you can maintain multiple objects, each of which has different but
permanent attributes. Or you can make a temporary copy of the object
and modify that, e.g.:</p>
<pre>
    $obj-&gt;clone-&gt;stderr(1)-&gt;system;
    $obj-&gt;clone({stderr=&gt;1})-&gt;system;</pre>
<p>each of which will leave <code>$obj</code> unaffected.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_autochomp">autochomp</a></strong>

<p>All data returned by the <a href="#item_qx"><code>qx</code></a> or <a href="#item_pipe"><code>pipe</code></a> methods is chomped first.
Unset by default.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_autofail">autofail</a></strong>

<p>When set, the program will exit immediately if the <a href="#item_system"><code>system</code></a>, <a href="#item_qx"><code>qx</code></a>, or
<a href="#item_pipe"><code>pipe</code></a> methods detect a nonzero status. Unset by default.</p>
<p>Autofail may also be given a code-ref, in which case that function will
be called upon error. This provides a basic exception-handling system:</p>
<pre>
    $obj-&gt;autofail(sub { print STDERR &quot;caught an exception\n&quot;; exit 17 });</pre>
<p>Any failed executions by <code>$obj</code> will result in the above message and
an immediate exit with return code == 17. Alternatively, if the
reference provided is an array-ref, the first element of that array is
assumed to be a code-ref as above and the rest of the array is passed
as args to the function on failure. Thus:</p>
<pre>
    $obj-&gt;autofail([&amp;handler, $arg1, $arg2]);</pre>
<p>Will call <code>handler($arg1, $arg2)</code> on error. It's even possible to
turn the handler into a <code>fake method</code> by passing the object ref:</p>
<pre>
    $obj-&gt;autofail([&amp;handler, $obj, $arg1, $arg2]);</pre>
<p>If the reference is to a scalar, the scalar is incremented for each
error and execution continues. Switching to a class method example:</p>
<pre>
    my $rc = 0;
    Argv-&gt;autofail(\$rc);
    [do stuff involving Argv objects]
    print &quot;There were $rc failures counted by Argv\n&quot;;
    exit($rc);</pre>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_syfail_2cqxfail">syfail,qxfail</a></strong>

<p>Similar to <a href="#item_autofail"><code>autofail</code></a> but apply only to <a href="#item_system"><code>system()</code></a> or
<a href="#item_qx"><code>qx()</code></a>/<a href="#item_pipe"><code>pipe()</code></a> respectively. Unset by default.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_lastresults">lastresults</a></strong>

<p>Within an <a href="#item_autofail"><code>autofail</code></a> handler this may be used to get access to the
results of the failed execution.  The return code and stdout of the
last command will be stored and can be retrieved as follows:</p>
<pre>
    # set up handler as a fake method (see above)
    $obj-&gt;autofail([&amp;handler, $obj, $arg1, $arg2]);</pre>
<pre>
    # then later, in the handler
    my $self = shift;                   # get the obj ref
    my @output = $self-&gt;lastresults;    # gives stdout in list context
    my $rc = $self-&gt;lastresults;        # and retcode in scalar</pre>
<p>Note that stdout is only available for -&gt;qx, not for -&gt;system.
And stderr is never available unless you've explicitly redirected it to
stdout. This is just the way Perl I/O works.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_envp">envp</a></strong>

<p>Allows a different environment to be provided during execution of the
object. This setting is in scope only for the child process and will
not affect the environment of the current process.  Takes a hashref:</p>
<pre>
    my %newenv = %ENV;
    $newenv{PATH} .= ':/usr/ucb';
    delete @newenv{qw(TERM LANG LD_LIBRARY_PATH)};
    $obj-&gt;envp(\%newenv);</pre>
<p>Subsequent invocations of <em>$obj</em> will add <em>/usr/ucb</em> to PATH and
subtract TERM, LANG, and LD_LIBRARY_PATH.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_autoglob">autoglob</a></strong>

<p>If set, the <a href="#item_glob"><code>glob()</code></a> function is applied to the operands
(<a href="#item_args"><code>$obj-&gt;args</code></a>) on Windows only. Unset by default.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_autoquote">autoquote</a></strong>

<p>If set, the operands are automatically quoted against shell expansion
before <a href="#item_system"><code>system()</code></a> on Windows and <a href="#item_qx"><code>qx()</code></a> on all platforms (since
<a href="#item_qx"><code>qx()</code></a> <em>always</em> invokes a shell and <a href="#item_system"><code>system()</code></a> always does so on
Windows).  Set by default.</p>
<p>An individual word of an argv can opt out of autoquoting by using a
leading '^'. For instance:</p>
<pre>
    ('aa', 'bb', &quot;^I'll do this one myself, thanks!&quot;, 'cc')</pre>
<p>The '^' is stripped off and the rest of the string left alone.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_dbglevel">dbglevel</a></strong>

<p>Sets the debug level. Level 0 (the default) means no debugging, level 1
prints each command before executing it, and higher levels offer
progressively more output. All debug output goes to stderr.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_dfltsets">dfltsets</a></strong>

<p>Sets and/or returns the default set of <em>option sets</em> to be used in
building up the command line at execution time.  The default-default is
the <em>anonymous option set</em>. <em>Note: this method takes a <strong>hash
reference</strong> as its optional argument and returns a hash ref as well</em>.
The selected sets are represented by the hash keys; the values are
meaningless.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_execwait">execwait</a></strong>

<p>If set, <a href="#item_exec"><code>$obj-&gt;exec</code></a> on Windows blocks until the new process is
finished for a more consistent UNIX-like behavior than the traditional
Win32 Perl port. Perl just uses the Windows <a href="#item_exec"><code>exec()</code></a> routine, which runs
the new process in the background. Set by default.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_inpathnorm">inpathnorm</a></strong>

<p>If set, normalizes pathnames to their native format just before
executing. This is NOT set by default, and even when set it's a no-op
except on Windows where it converts /x/y/z to \x\y\z. Only the <em>prog</em>
and <em>args</em> lists are normalized; options placed in the <em>opts</em> list
are left alone.</p>
<p>However, for better or worse it's common to lump opts and args together
so some attempt is made to separate them heuristically.  The algorithm
is that if the word begins with <code>/</code> we consider that it might be an
option and look more carefully: otherwise we switch all slashes to
backslashes.  If a word is in the form <code>/opt:stuff</code> we assume <em>stuff</em>
is meant as a path and convert it. Otherwise words which look like
options (start with a slash and contain no other slashes) are left
alone.</p>
<p>This is necessarily an inexact science. In particular there is an
ambiguity with combined options, e.g. /E/I/Q.  This is a legal pathname
and is treated as such. Therefore, do not set combined options as part
of the <em>args</em> list when making use of argument path norming. Some
Windows commands accept Unix-style options (-x -y) as well which can be
useful for disambiguation.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_outpathnorm">outpathnorm</a></strong>

<p>If set, normalizes pathnames returned by the <a href="#item_qx"><code>qx</code></a> method from
\-delimited to /-delimited. This is NOT set by default; even when set
it's a no-op except on Windows.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_noexec">noexec</a></strong>

<p>Analogous to the <code>-n</code> flag to <em>make</em>; prints what would be executed
without executing anything.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_qxargs">qxargs</a></strong>

<p>Sets a maximum command line length for each execution, allowing you to
blithely invoke <a href="#item_qx"><code>$obj-&gt;qx</code></a> on a list of any size without fear of
exceeding OS or shell limits. <em>The attribute is set to a per-platform
default</em>; this method allows it to be changed as described below.</p>
<p>A value of 0 turns off the feature; all arguments will be thrown onto
one command line and if that's too big it will fail. A positive value
specifies the maximum number of <strong>arguments</strong> to place on each command
line.  As the number of args has only a tenuous relationship with the
length of the command line, this usage is deprecated and retained only
for historical reasons (but see below). A negative value sets the
overall command line length in <strong>bytes</strong>, which is a more sensible way
to handle it.  As a special case, a value of <code>-1</code> sets the limit to
that reported by the system (<code>getconf ARG_MAX</code> on POSIX platforms,
32767 on Windows).  The default is <code>-1</code>.  Examples:</p>
<pre>
    $obj-&gt;qxargs(0);            # no cmdline length limit
    $obj-&gt;qxargs(-2048);        # limit cmdlines to 2048 bytes
    $obj-&gt;qxargs(-1);           # limit cmdlines to ARG_MAX bytes
    $obj-&gt;qxargs(256);          # limit cmdlines to 256 arguments</pre>
<p>Notes: The actual cmdline length limit is somewhat less than ARG_MAX on
POSIX systems for reasons too complex to explain here.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_syxargs">syxargs</a></strong>

<p>Analogous to <em>qxargs</em> but applies to <a href="#item_system"><code>system()</code></a>. Unlike <em>qxargs</em>,
this is turned off by default. The reason is that <a href="#item_qx"><code>qx()</code></a> is typically
used to <em>read</em> data whereas <a href="#item_system"><code>system()</code></a> is more often used to make
stateful changes.  Consider that ``ls foo bar'' produces the same result
if broken up into ``ls foo'' and ``ls bar'' but the same cannot be said for
``mv foo bar''.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_stdout">stdout</a></strong>

<p>Setting this attribute to 0, e.g:</p>
<pre>
    $obj-&gt;stdout(0);</pre>
<p>causes STDOUT to be connected to the <code>1&gt;/dev/null</code> (Unix) or NUL
(Windows) device during invocation of the <em>execution methods</em>
<a href="#item_system"><code>system</code></a>, <a href="#item_qx"><code>qx</code></a>, and <a href="#item_exec"><code>exec</code></a> and restored when they finish. Relieves
the programmer of the burden and noise of opening, dup-ing, and
restoring temporary handles.</p>
<p>A value of 2 is the equivalent of using <code>1&gt;&amp;2</code> to the shell,
meaning that it would send stdout to the stderr device.</p>
<p>It's also possible to pass any non-numeric EXPR; these will be passed
to open().  For instance, to accumulate output from the current object
in <code>/tmp/foo</code> use:</p>
<pre>
    $obj-&gt;stdout(&quot;&gt;&gt;/tmp/foo&quot;);</pre>
<p>Note that in this usage, responsibility for portable constructs such as
the existence of <em>/tmp</em> belongs to the programmer.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>stderr</strong>

<p>As above, for STDERR. A value of 1 is the equivalent of <code>2&gt;&amp;1</code>,
meaning that it sends stderr to the stdout device. E.g.:</p>
<pre>
    @alloutput = $obj-&gt;stderr(1)-&gt;qx;</pre>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_stdin">stdin</a></strong>

<p>As above, for STDIN, but note that setting -&gt;stdin to 0 is a no-op.
To turn off standard input it's necessary to use a negative value:</p>
<pre>
    $obj-&gt;stdin(-1);</pre>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_quiet">quiet</a></strong>

<p>This attribute causes STDOUT to be closed during invocation of the
<a href="#item_system"><code>system</code></a> and <code> exec</code> (but not <a href="#item_qx"><code>qx</code></a>) <em>execution methods</em>. It will
cause the application to run more quietly. This takes precedence over
a redirection of STDOUT using the &lt;$obj-&gt;stdout&gt; method above.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_attropts">attropts</a></strong>

<p>The above attributes can be set via method calls (e.g.
<a href="#item_dbglevel"><code>$obj-&gt;dbglevel(1)</code></a>) or environment variables (ARGV_DBGLEVEL=1). Use
of the &lt;$obj-&gt;attropts&gt; method allows them to be parsed from the command
line as well, e.g. <em>myscript -/dbglevel 1</em>. If invoked as a class
method it causes options of the same names as the methods above to be
parsed (and removed) from the current <code>@ARGV</code> and set as class
attributes.  As an instance method it parses and potentially depletes
the current argument vector of that object, and sets instance attributes
only. E.g.:</p>
<pre>
    Argv-&gt;attropts;</pre>
<p>would cause the script to parse the following command line:</p>
<pre>
    script -/noexec 1 -/dbglevel=2 -flag1 -flag2 arg1 arg2 arg3 ...</pre>
<p>so as to remove the <code>-/noexec 1 -/dbglevel 2</code> and set the two class
attrs.  The <code>-/</code> prefix is chosen to prevent conflicts with ``real''
flags. Abbreviations are allowed as long as they're unique within the
set of -/ flags. As an instance method:</p>
<pre>
    $obj-&gt;attropts;</pre>
<p>it will parse the current value of <a href="#item_args"><code>$obj-&gt;args</code></a> and run</p>
<pre>
    $obj-&gt;foo(1);</pre>
<p>for every instance of <code>-/foo=1</code> found there.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This module is primarily maintained on Solaris 9 and Windows XP using

<hr />
<h1><a name="bugs">BUGS</a></h1>
<p>It's not exactly a bug but ... this module served as my laboratory for
learning about Perl OO, autoloading, and various other advanced Perl
topics. Therefore it was not written in a disciplined manner; rather, I
stuck in every neat idea I was playing with at the time. As a result,
though it works well as far as I know, there's a hopeless array of ways
to do everything. I know the motto of Perl is TMTOWTDI but Argv goes
one further: TWTMWTDE (There's Way Too Many Ways To Do Everything).</p>
<p>For instance, to run commands with different values for execution
attributes such as <a href="#item_autoquote"><code>autoquote</code></a> or <a href="#item_stderr"><code>stderr</code></a>, you can keep multiple
instances around with different attribute sets, or you can keep one
<em>template</em> instance which you clone-and-modify before each execution,
letting the clone go out of scope immediately:</p>
<pre>
    $obj-&gt;clone-&gt;stderr(0)-&gt;system;</pre>
<p>Or you can keep one instance around and modify its state before each
use. Or toggle the class attributes while leaving the instance
attributes untouched. Which is better?  I don't know the answer, but
choosing a consistent style is a good idea.</p>
