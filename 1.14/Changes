Revision history for Perl extension ClearCase::Wrapper::DSB.

1.01 Fri Jan 25 09:38:23 EST 2002
	- original version
	  Much of the original content of ClearCase::Wrapper has
	  been split out into this overlay module.

	- Cleaned up 'eclipse' extension.

1.06 Tue May  7 10:22:32 EDT 2002
	- Minor formatting improvements.
	- Added -needed flag to setcs.

1.07 Fri Oct 18 12:10:40 EDT 2002
	- Override 'rmelem' to flush the view cache when done.
	- Override 'update' to add -quiet flag (suppress "Loading ..." msgs)

	- Added -chown/chgrp/-chmod plus -tag and -replace to protectview.

1.09 Tue Jul 22 10:56:06 EDT 2003
	- Fixed contact data.

1.10 Thu Mar 10 11:30:00 EST 2005
	- Added "describe -par/ents" feature.

1.11 Mon Mar 14 00:00:51 EST 2005
	- Cleanups occasioned by port to new environment.
	  Worked around an apparent bug in 5.6.1: the statement
	  "local $0 = ..." causes the user's PATH to be trashed such
	  that $ENV{PATH} looks ok but "system qw(printenv PATH)"
	  doesn't. It's hard to see how that could be my bug but
	  in any case it's not a problem in more modern Perls so
	  I just worked around it.

1.12 Fri Oct  7 09:30:58 EDT 2005
	- Fix bug reported by anonymous user. ClearCase::Argv
	  renamed the ->cleartool method to ->find_cleartool;
	  this module forgot to track that change till now.
	  This caused "ct setcs -clone <view-tag>" to fail.

1.13 Wed Mar 29 11:42:37 EST 2006
	- Fixed a minor warning in "ct lock".

1.14 Thu May 13 17:09:45 EDT 2010
	- Fixed a file-mode bug in "ct reco/recheckout".
	- Pushed recursion support up into ClearCase::Wrapper for
	  use by other overlay modules.
	- Tweaked indenting in show usage functions
